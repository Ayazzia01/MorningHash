*Are you doing Competitive Programming and want your JAVA code to run faster?*
Instead of switching to the terminal in each loop to print-
for(int i=1;i<5;i++){
System.out.println("Print");}

Try using JAVA's inbuilt _StringBuffer_ class to print instead-
StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer();
for(int i=1;i<5;i++){
sb.append("Print \n");}
System.out.println(sb);

*Don't want to write long lines of code for _BinarySearch_?*
Take advantage of JAVA's inbuilt Arrays.binarySearch(int [ ], int).

int intArr[] = { 10, 20, 15, 22, 35 };
Arrays.sort(intArr);
int intKey = 22;
System.out.println(intKey + " found at index = " + Arrays.binarySearch(intArr, intKey));

_// Output - 22 found at index = 3
